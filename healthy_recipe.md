   - Add the pressed tofu cubes, red bell pepper, zucchini, and red onion. Coat well with the marinade. 
   - Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to 2 hours for more flavor).

2. **Prepare the Tzatziki Sauce:**
   - In a bowl, combine Greek yogurt (or plant-based yogurt), grated cucumber, minced garlic, olive oil, dill, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. 
   - Mix well and refrigerate until ready to serve.

3. **Make the Greek Salad:**
   - In a large salad bowl, combine the chopped romaine, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, olives, and feta cheese (or plant-based feta). 
   - In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper. 
   - Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.

4. **Cook the Vegetable Souvlaki:**
   - Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.
   - Thread the marinated tofu and vegetable pieces onto the soaked wooden skewers.
   - Grill the skewers for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally until the tofu is heated through and has nice grill marks.

**Serving Suggestions:**

- Serve the Vegetable Souvlaki skewers alongside the Greek Salad and a generous dollop of Tzatziki sauce for dipping.
- Place the warm pita bread on the side for guests to create their own wraps with the tofu and salad.
- Garnish with fresh lemon wedges for an extra zesty kick.
- Consider serving a light red wine or sparkling water with lemon for a refreshing beverage option.

**Explanation of Replaced Ingredients:**
- The chicken in the original recipe has been replaced with firm tofu, which provides a substantial base and absorbs the flavors of the marinade well.
- The addition of bell peppers, zucchini, and red onion adds color, nutrition, and variety to the skewers, keeping the dish vibrant and flavorful.
- The Greek yogurt can be substituted with a plant-based yogurt alternative for a vegan option, while still maintaining the creamy texture of the tzatziki sauce.
- Feta cheese has a plant-based alternative available for those who prefer vegan options, ensuring everyone can enjoy the meal.
