#### Dessert: Baklava

**Ingredients:**
- 450g phyllo dough, thawed
- 300g walnuts, finely chopped
- 150g unsalted butter (or a plant-based butter alternative), melted
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup honey (or a suitable vegan substitute like agave syrup)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

**Preparation Instructions:**
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a bowl, mix chopped walnuts with ground cinnamon and set aside.
3. Brush a 9x13 inch baking dish with melted butter (or plant-based butter). Layer 10 sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each layer with melted butter.
4. Spread a layer of the walnut mixture (about 1/4 of the mixture) over the phyllo. Add another 5 sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter. Repeat the layering process until all the walnut mixture is used, finishing with 10 sheets of phyllo on top, brushing the final layer with butter.
5. Cut the baklava into diamond shapes with a sharp knife.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes until golden brown.
7. In a saucepan, combine sugar, water, honey (or agave syrup), and vanilla extract. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool.
8. Pour the cooled syrup over the hot baklava immediately after removing it from the oven. Allow it to soak for at least 4 hours or overnight before serving.

#### Serving Suggestions:
- Serve the Greek salad as a refreshing start to the meal.
- Present the tempeh souvlaki with dairy-free tzatziki sauce in warm pita bread or with a side of rice.
- Enjoy the baklava as a sweet ending to the dinner, perhaps accompanied by a cup of Greek coffee or herbal tea.

#### Explanation of Replaced Ingredients:
- **Tempeh:** Used as a plant-based protein substitute for chicken. It has a firm texture and absorbs flavors well, making it suitable for grilling and maintaining the essence of the dish.
- **Dairy-Free Yogurt:** Replaces Greek yogurt in the tzatziki sauce to accommodate vegetarian preferences while keeping a creamy texture.
- **Plant-Based Feta:** Optional, can be used instead of traditional feta to maintain the vegetarian aspect while offering a similar flavor profile.
- **Plant-Based Butter:** Can be used in Baklava as a substitute for unsalted butter to ensure the dish is suitable for a vegetarian diet.
- **Honey:** A vegan substitute like agave syrup can be used in Baklava to make it completely plant-based.
