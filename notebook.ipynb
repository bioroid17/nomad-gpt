      "This year has not been great for the box office. In fact, Memorial Day was the worst weekend for the movies since the '90s. The entire domestic box office pulled in just $126 million — in years past, the No. 1 movie alone has made as much as $160 million, as \"Top Gun: Maverick\" did in 2022.A few factors have led to this. Mainly, the WGA/SAG strikes last year put many productions on pause, so some of the bigger movies won't come out until later in the year.Another factor is streaming and VOD. \"Furiosa,\" which came out a little over six weeks ago, is already available to rent at home. For a family, it's cheaper to spend $30 to rent something at home than $50-plus on tickets, snacks, and drinks.And finally, people apparently just aren't convinced they need to see some of these films on the big screen. Why go see Kevin Costner's new Western when you can watch him in \"Yellowstone\" at home?\n",

      "\"Horizon\" was a huge gamble for its star/director/writer/producer, Kevin Costner. Costner mortgaged his home in Santa Barbara and invested $38 million of his own fortune to fund the film.He also left his lucrative role on the smash-hit TV show \"Yellowstone\" due to scheduling conflicts with \"Horizon.\"It's an ambitious task — Costner sees \"Horizon\" as a four-part series that he planned on releasing over the course of a few months. \"Chapter 1\" was released in June and made $11 million on its first weekend. A rough start for a movie that cost as much as $100 million to make.New Line, its distributor, apparently agreed. \"Chapter 2\" was supposed to hit movie theaters on August 16, but the sequel was pulled from the schedule and now sits in limbo.\n",

      "Anya Taylor-Joy in \"Furiosa.\"\n",
      " Warner Bros.\n",
      "As The Wrap pointed out, \"Furiosa's\" $32 million opening weekend is the lowest No. 1 total for a Memorial Day Weekend since 1995, when \"Casper\" topped the box office with $22 million.Another depressing stat for the \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" prequel? According to Screen Rant, it had the worst second-week drop of any \"Mad Max\" movie, plunging a staggering 59%.Now, why exactly is \"Furiosa\" flopping so hard? It might be a case of unreasonable expectations. \"Fury Road\" is rightfully hailed as one of the best action movies of all time, but it didn't light the box office on fire at first either. Its domestic opening in 2015 was $42.4 million, ending up at a respectable $380 million worldwide.Also, Anya-Taylor Joy (who plays the titular Furiosa) is famous but not a definite movie star yet — arguably, her big break was for a TV show (\"The Queen's Gambit\"), and her last big cinematic hits (\"Dune: Part Two\" and \"The Menu\") were sold on bigger stars like Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, and Ralph Fiennes.By July, the film hadn't crossed the $175 million mark worldwide.\n",

The other film that opened as counter-programming that weekend was \"The Garfield Movie,\" the second animated adaptation of everyone's favorite grumpy cat.The film, which stars Chris Pratt as Garfield, made just $31 million on its opening weekend. So, between \"Garfield\" and \"Furiosa,\" the top two movies at the box office made a total of $63 million.For context, the No. 1 movie at the box office last Memorial Day weekend was \"The Little Mermaid,\" which made $118 million.After the billion-dollar success of \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" (also starring Pratt), \"Garfield\" simply couldn't measure up. The other big animated movie of the year, \"Kung Fu Panda 4,\" opened to $57 million and has made $541 million worldwide.When \"Inside Out 2\" was released, that's when it was truly curtains for Garfield. The Pixar sequel has already made $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing movie of the year.\n",

      "An action rom-com led by the two of the stars of last year's box-office phenomenon, Barbenheimer? You'd think that'd be a no-brainer smash, but \"The Fall Guy\" hasn't lived up to those lofty expectations.Variety reported that the film was projected to debut between $30 and $40 million, but it made just $28.5 million. At this point, it's made $177 million worldwide.As Business Insider's Jason Guerrasio noted before the film premiered, this May was the first time in 17 years (excluding 2020) that a Marvel movie of some kind hasn't kicked off the summer. Last May's Marvel film, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,\" made $118 million domestically in its opening weekend.With that looming over its head, it's no surprise that \"The Fall Guy,\" based on the little-remembered '80s TV show of the same name, couldn't measure up.\n",

      "Put aside the deeply annoying \"Who is the real Agent Argylle?\" marketing campaign and think about how wild this is: \"Argylle,\" an action spy-thriller starring Oscar-winner Sam Rockwell, former Superman Henry Cavill, the former star of a multi-billion-dollar franchise Bryce Dallas Howard, living legend Samuel L. Jackson, comedy icon Catherine O'Hara, beloved actor Bryan Cranston, and current pop star Dua Lipa couldn't crack $100 million at the box-office.Compare that to the $200 million it cost Apple to make, as reported by Indiewire, and that's a true box-office bomb, even if Apple claims otherwise.\n",

      "If you're unfamiliar with the Sony Spider-Man Universe (or the SSU), here's a quick explanation: Marvel (and, therefore, Disney) now owns the rights to almost all of its comic characters. The one property it can't get back? Spider-Man and all his related villains, friends, and love interests, which are still owned by Sony.Although Sony and Disney have agreed on a deal that allows Spidey to appear in the MCU, Sony is still holding tight to the rest of his associates, which is how we end up with films like \"Venom,\" \"Morbius,\" \"Kraven the Hunter,\" and yes, \"Madame Web.\"Why Sony thought this movie was a good idea is beyond us — Madame Web is a little-known character (and matters even less without, you know, Spider-Man around to help save the day), and star Dakota Johnson hasn't proven herself to be a cinematic draw outside IP-driven properties like \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" which made a combined $1.3 billion worldwide.With a dismal worldwide box office of $100 million, all that the SSU has proven is that these movies make for good memes.\n",

He began starring in \"The Witcher\" in 2019 (a very successful show by all accounts), only to leave after season three. It's never been officially announced why he left, but the timing did line up with his cameo as Superman in the DCEU film \"Black Adam\" in 2022.Unfortunately for Cavill, when James Gunn took over the DC film division, he announced his plans to scrap the entire DCEU (DC Extended Universe) and start fresh with a brand-new Superman, now played by David Corenswet.And now, Cavill's last two films since his last appearance as Superman in \"The Flash\" have bombed.\n",

His first, \"The Harder They Fall,\" was a critical success and enjoyed by viewers, but it debuted on Netflix, so it was hard to gauge what the box office would be like for his follow-up.It turns out that biblical comedy doesn't go over as well as a Western. According to Variety, \"The Book of Clarence\" cost $40 million to produce and made only $6.2 million worldwide.\n",

      "Cole Sprouse and Kathryn Newton have been tapped as potential movie stars in the next generation of Hollywood and have each been in successful films.However, their star power and the value of \"Frankenstein\" as intellectual property didn't help this '80s teen comedy earn money.Even though it was a relatively cheap film to make at just $13 million, according to Variety, it couldn't crack double digits at the box office.

      "After several rough years for movies, 2024 has seen an upward trend for major franchises at the worldwide box office. Films like Deadpool & Wolverine, Inside Out 2, and Alien: Romulus prove that audiences still want to see movies in theaters. However, not every new film this summer has been as successful as they are.\n",
      "Despite many hits, not every movie released in the summer of 2024 has had the same success. The season saw some of the biggest flops in recent memory, from the abysmal performance of Borderlands to Kevin Costner's costly new Horizon franchise. Many of these films had massive budgets but failed to make back the money put into them. These are the summer's biggest box office flops so far, according to The Numbers.\n",
      "A standard metric to calculate a film's success is that it must make back double its production budget to be profitable. While profitability can be complicated, all estimated losses in this list are calculated using this metric.\n",

But even fan-favorite and critically acclaimed movies like Donnie Darko and Scott Pilgrim can flop hard.4 \n",
      "The legacy sequel that movie fans didn't know they wanted, Twisters reignites the natural disaster franchise with elevated stakes and a star-studded cast that includes Glen Powell, Daisy Edgar-Jones, Anthony Ramos, David Corenswet, and more. Domestically, the film was the surprise hit of the summer, earning over $260 million in the United States for a worldwide total of $365 million (according to The Numbers).\n",
      "In the United States, it would be almost unthinkable to look at Twisters as a box office disappointment. Not only was the movie financially successful domestically, but it also became a cultural icon. Nevertheless, in an odd paradox, Twisters barely picked up any traction overseas, where it earned less than half of its global total. While the movie will still be profitable, it is strange to see a movie that was so popular domestically utterly flop abroad.\n",

      "With acclaimed director John Krasinski at the helm and a star-studded cast led by Ryan Reynolds, IF was one of the most highly anticipated movies of the summer. The movie imagined a world wherein imaginary friends came to life, with a colorful cast of fantastical creatures turning one little girl's life upside down.\n",
      "Despite its inventive premise, dazzling special effects, and stellar cast, IF only earned $184 million worldwide (according to The Numbers). With so much going in its favor and a strong marketing push from Paramount, it isn't clear why the movie flopped. Critics' mixed reviews may have been to blame for IF's lackluster box office pull, leaving any plans for potential sequels strictly in the realm of imagination.\n",

      "The Exorcism marked Russell Crowe's second exorcist movie in as many years (after The Pope's Exorcist last year), with the actor playing a down-and-out actor who begins to experience strange phenomena on a horror film set. He gradually comes to believe that there is an evil spirit on the set of the movie and does all he can to cleanse the area before it gets control of the cast.\n",
      "If the plot of The Exorcism sounds familiar, it's likely because it is the plot of about a dozen other similar films. That might be why Russell Crowe's latest supernatural horror film only earned a paltry $8.6 million in its entire run (according to The Numbers). Even with a minuscule budget, The Exorcism couldn't earn enough to make a profit and was forgotten just as quickly as it arrived.\n",

      "The Bikeriders is a period drama following the exploits of the Vandals Motorcycle Club in 1960s Chicago. The film depicts the dangers that come with living a life of crime, as things quickly spiral out of control from the Vandals. The movie received mostly positive reviews and boasted terrific performances from an impressive cast that included Austin Butler, Jodie Comer, and Tom Hardy.\n",
      "There was some considerable hype for The Bikeriders before it hit theaters but a series of delays may have been responsible for its disappointing $35 million box office total (according to The Numbers). The movie blew competition like The Exorcism and Thelma out of the water, but simply couldn't beat out the enduring popularity of other summer blockbusters, with Inside Out 2 still dominating the box office at the time of The Bikeriders' release.\n",

      "Starring Zachary Levi in the lead role, Harold and the Purple Crayon is a film adaptation of the popular children's book series of the same name. The movie imagines an older version of Harold who comes to the real world along with his trusty purple crayon, which can create anything he can imagine.\n",
      "Despite a premise built around imagination itself, Harold and the Purple Crayon is sorely lacking in creativity, which may be blamed for its laughable $22 million box office earnings (according to The Numbers). Additionally, audiences were unmoved by the film's lackluster trailers and instead chose to spend money on other better films released this summer.\n",

      "Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter 1 is a passion project from legendary actor Kevin Costner, who financed, directed, co-wrote, produced, and starred in the film. Horizon tells the story of the American expansion westward in the mid-1800s. The film was meant to be the first in a four-part saga that would be the definitive Western epic.\n",
      "Despite considerable work on Costner's part, Horizon only earned $31.5 million (according to The Numbers). Though the movie was responsibly budgeted at only $50 million, its losses are exacerbated by the plans for a four-part franchise. The second film is already shot but has been pulled from the release schedule as New Line Cinema wonders what to do with the rest of the franchise.

      "The Crow is a reimagining of the infamous 1994 film of the same name which is inextricably tied to the death and legacy of Brandon Lee. The reimagining follows Eric Draven, a young man who is murdered alongside his girlfriend by a wicked criminal syndicate. When he is resurrected as a vigilante known as the Crow, Draven plans to get revenge on those who killed him and his lover.\n",
      "The Crow was doomed as soon as it was announced, with fans immediately condemning the idea of a reboot. It didn't help that the film itself proved to be a middling, uninspired facsimile of a well-known story. The movie was trampled by its competition and earned an embarrassing $12.7 million worldwide, barely a quarter of its already low production budget (according to The Numbers). Unlike its protagonist, there is little hope for anyone to ever bring The Crow franchise back from the dead.\n",

Anya Taylor-Joy steps into the role of Furiosa for this prequel, which pits her character against Chris Hemsworth's terrifying dystopian warlord, Dementus.\n",
      "In a surprise twist of fate, Furiosa bombed at the box office, earning only $172.4 million (according to The Numbers). This was quite the shock considering just how excited fans were to see more of Furiosa's character, especially after she proved to be the standout in Fury Road. Nevertheless, mixed reviews may have killed this highly anticipated prequel--and potentially doomed the Mad Max franchise.\n",

      "Fly Me to the Moon is a romantic comedy starring Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson. The film follows a NASA executive and a marketing whiz who meet while they prepare for the Apollo 11 mission. Fly Me to the Moon tells this couple's love story set against the backdrop of one of the most significant historical events of all time.\n",
      "If viewers haven't heard of Fly Me to the Moon, they may not be alone, as the film barely broke the $20 million mark in its entire box office run (according to The Numbers).

      "When it comes to failed films of the summer, there is truly no competition for the biggest flop. Borderlands is a truly terrible video game adaptation that gave neither original fans nor newcomers what they were looking for. Based on the popular video game series of the same name, Borderlands put together a team of misfits for an out-of-this-world mission that supposedly will have major effects on the entire universe.\n",
      "Most box office analysts predicted that Borderlands would flop, but few could foresee just how heavily it would fail. The movie barely scrounged up $30 million at the worldwide box office (according to The Numbers), putting it nearly $200 million in the hole. There are far too many factors that sank Borderlands to list here, but suffice it to say the movie was disappointing on all counts and will forever be remembered as one of the worst video game adaptations of all time.\n",
