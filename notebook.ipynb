      "While blockbusters “Dune: Part Two” and “Inside Out 2” rode the coattails of their prequels to become the top two highest grossing movies so far this year, a much greater list of Hollywood hopefuls failed to perform in the U.S., including thrillers, horrors and comedies.\n",

      "Key Facts\n",
      "The worst-performing major release of the first six months of 2024 was Focus Features’ horror romance film “Lisa Frankenstein” (Forbes tracked the lowest-grossing major releases that played at over 3,000 theaters).\n",
      "The Cole Sprouse and Kathryn Newton high school crush feature grossed only $9.77 million in U.S. theaters since its Feb. 9 release, and scored a 51% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n",
      "Several other horror movies made for the biggest flops of the year, including Dakota Fanning’s “The Watchers,” which has pulled in $18.95 million since its release earlier this month, with an even worse critic score on Rotten Tomatoes (32%).\n",
      "Among the major flops were several big-budget action movies, including “Madame Web,” the poorly reviewed Sydney Sweeney and Dakota Johnson superhero feature with a reported $80 million budget, and Universal Pictures’ “Argylle,” which fell just out the top 10 list after grossing $45.21 million despite a reported $200 million budget.\n",

      "“Madame Web” ($43.82 million)\n",
      "Key Background\n",
      "2024 has been a rough year for Hollywood studios still recovering from the Covid-era box office doldrums, especially as streaming platforms increasingly compete with theaters. Comscore media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said last month he believes this summer’s box office gross could fall $800 million below last summer, which raked in over $4 billion—the most since the pandemic. Last year’s Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes also stunted the summer box office, pushing the release date of several major films from 2024 to 2025, notably Paramount’s upcoming sequel to its “Mission: Impossible” franchise.\n",
      "Tangent\n",
      "Kevin Costner’s “Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 1,” the long-awaited first installment of Costner’s western epic, grossed just over $11 million from its June 28 release through June 30, according to Box Office Mojo. While that performance would put it second on the list of worst-performing movies of the first half of the year, it does not appear on the list because it has only been in theaters for a single weekend, and its domestic gross is expected to grow from its underwhelming start.\n",
      "What To Watch For\n",
      "Several major releases out last month are expected to become some of the highest-grossing movies of the year, including Disney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2,” which boasted a $155 million U.S. opening—the biggest since “Barbie”—and Will Smith’s “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” which posted an impressive $56 million in its opening weekend last month, far surpassing expectations. Other upcoming releases include Eddie Murphy’s “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” (July 3), horror “MaXXXine” (July 5), “Fly Me to the Moon” (July 12), “Twisters” (July 19) and “Deadpool and Wolverine” (July 26).\n",

      "(Welcome to the Entertainment Strategy Guy, a newsletter on the entertainment industry and business strategy. I write a weekly Streaming Ratings Report and a bi-weekly strategy column, along with occasional deep dives into other topics, like today’s article. Please subscribe.)\n",
      "Here’s perhaps the funniest/oddest streaming viewership factoid of the year:\n",
      "Notorious box office bomb Madame Web crushed it on the streaming ratings charts this year. \n",
      "No seriously, see for yourself:\n",
      "It had the fifth biggest opening week this year at 19.4 million hours! In terms of viewing in the first four weeks, it’s actually the ninth biggest film on streaming this year. I bring this up because…it’s that time of year! Time to check in on the worst-performing films in the first half of 2024. And Madame Web’s performance is really good context for all of the ratings (or lack thereof) that follow. When a box office bomb can deliver strong streaming numbers, it says something. \n",
      "If you want to read the full methodology for how I assemble this list, it’s at the bottom of this article. In short, this article is…\n",
      "…scripted and unscripted films,\n",
      "…that went straight-to-streaming,\n",
      "…from the eight major streamers,\n",
      "…in the US (using US-only ratings),\n",
      "…excluding true crime, short films (anything shorter than twenty minutes), “making of” specials, and foreign-language films.\n",
      "Some notes: First, price matters. If a film costs north of $100 million, then it needs to get lots and lots of streaming viewership to justify that budget. For films, I don’t make a distinction between a “flop” and a “flop for them”. (This will be different next week when we get to TV shows.)\n",
      "Next, we have a fun ratings data update! We now have Luminate’s weekly top ten data, which is great! More data is always better. For movies, Luminate’s top ten list only includes straight-to-streaming films, which is bad news for a lot of films. If a film misses the Luminate charts, that’s a really bad sign and, worse, some films made the charts with really low viewership, just confirming what we already knew or should have suspected.\n",
      "As with past editions, I ordered this list by streamer, going from best (least number of flops) to worst (the most misses), taking the size of the flops into consideration. Reminder: this article does not represent my personal opinion—many of these films are great!—but I follow the data and a miss is a miss, and a bomb is a bomb.\n",
      "For the first time in the bi-annual flops, bombs and misses collection, I included some notable theatrical streaming flops at the very end of the article. In terms of putting together the most comprehensive, accurate look at films on streaming in 2024, this just seems fair.\n",
      "The Key Question: Should Films Go to Theaters First?\n",
      "Looking at the business context this year, 2024 has been a rough year at both the box office…and on streaming. Starting with theatrical releases, even after a terrific June, July and August, box office receipts are still down about 15% compared to last year. Why? Well, as I wrote for the Ankler last March, it’s an issue of supply. Not enough films are going to theaters these days.\n",
      "Unfortunately, as I covered for The Ankler, streaming hasn’t had a lot of success either in launching straight-to-streaming films this year. There were some (Damsel, Road House, and Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F), but not a lot.\n",
      "At least three streamers (Netflix, Amazon, and Apple) still send a fair number of big-budget films straight-to-streaming. (After committing to theaters last year, Apple Studios has reversed course, and started pulling films from their theatrical calendar.) And Hulu (mostly via Searchlight, post-Fox merger with Disney) still sends a fair number of films straight-to-Hulu.\n",
      "The question is why. As for Apple and Amazon, I think we know why they’re not sending films to theaters: they don’t want the negative PR, as I wrote about here and here. As for Netflix, it’s a strategic decision, just one I don’t agree with or think that the data supports. Both Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos have repeatedly said that they’re not in the theatrical business. That said, Netflix sure seems to rely on theatrically-released films like Madame Web. Finally, for everyone else, if you see a film go straight-to-streaming, I think it means that the studio is burying it. \n",
      "Thus that key question—“Should these streaming flops have gone to theaters?—lingers over this entire article, as it has the last couple of editions. Each streamer offers a different answer to that question.\n",
      "Apple TV+\n",
      "Fancy Dance\n",
      "Honorable Mentions: The Bloody Hundredth, Girls State \n",
      "Winner: Fancy Dance\n",
      "Unlike the TV side of things, Apple TV+ was actually the most successful streamer in terms of film flops, meaning that they had the least (for the first half of the year). Even though Argylle flopped at the box office and on streaming, at least they gave it a chance in theaters.\n",
      "But the same can’t be said for Lily Gladstone and Sundance Lab’s indie film, Fancy Dance. Sundance, the BlackList, IllumiNative, and others worked hard to highlight the work of diverse voices, then this film was sold to Apple, who essentially buried it in June. Looking at this strategically, if your goal is increasing representation on screen, this choice to sell to Apple without a guaranteed theatrical release didn’t advance that goal.\n",
      "Disney+\n",
      "The Beach Boys\n",
      "Jim Henson: Idea Man\n",
      "Madu\n",
      "Tiger\n",
      "Honorable Mentions: Tigers on the Rise\n",
      "On the one hand, Disney+ had a good year, mainly because they’ve stopped sending big budget films (like Pinocchio or Peter Pan & Wendy) directly to Disney+, knowing that even box office bombs like Wish can do okay-ish numbers once they head to streaming. Instead, all of their film misses were unscripted documentaries. That said…\n",

      "After several rough years for movies, 2024 has seen an upward trend for major franchises at the worldwide box office. Films like Deadpool & Wolverine, Inside Out 2, and Alien: Romulus prove that audiences still want to see movies in theaters. However, not every new film this summer has been as successful as they are.\n",
      "Despite many hits, not every movie released in the summer of 2024 has had the same success. The season saw some of the biggest flops in recent memory, from the abysmal performance of Borderlands to Kevin Costner's costly new Horizon franchise. Many of these films had massive budgets but failed to make back the money put into them. These are the summer's biggest box office flops so far, according to The Numbers.\n",
      "A standard metric to calculate a film's success is that it must make back double its production budget to be profitable. While profitability can be complicated, all estimated losses in this list are calculated using this metric.\n",
      "10 Twisters' Box Office Is Complicated \n",
      "Worldwide Box Office: $365.8 million Production Budget: $155 million Needed For Profit: $310 million Related 10 Box Office Bombs That Critics Actually Loved Watching a movie is so easy these days. But even fan-favorite and critically acclaimed movies like Donnie Darko and Scott Pilgrim can flop hard.4 \n",
      "The legacy sequel that movie fans didn't know they wanted, Twisters reignites the natural disaster franchise with elevated stakes and a star-studded cast that includes Glen Powell, Daisy Edgar-Jones, Anthony Ramos, David Corenswet, and more. Domestically, the film was the surprise hit of the summer, earning over $260 million in the United States for a worldwide total of $365 million (according to The Numbers).\n",
      "In the United States, it would be almost unthinkable to look at Twisters as a box office disappointment. Not only was the movie financially successful domestically, but it also became a cultural icon. Nevertheless, in an odd paradox, Twisters barely picked up any traction overseas, where it earned less than half of its global total. While the movie will still be profitable, it is strange to see a movie that was so popular domestically utterly flop abroad.\n",
      " Twisters ActionAdventureThriller An update to the 1996 film 'Twister', which centered on a pair of storm chasers who risk their lives in an attempt to test an experimental weather alert system.

      "Worldwide Box Office: $184.7 million Production Budget: $110 million Needed For Profit: $220 million Estimated Loss (rounded): $35 million \n",
      "With acclaimed director John Krasinski at the helm and a star-studded cast led by Ryan Reynolds, IF was one of the most highly anticipated movies of the summer. The movie imagined a world wherein imaginary friends came to life, with a colorful cast of fantastical creatures turning one little girl's life upside down.\n",
      "Despite its inventive premise, dazzling special effects, and stellar cast, IF only earned $184 million worldwide (according to The Numbers). With so much going in its favor and a strong marketing push from Paramount, it isn't clear why the movie flopped. Critics' mixed reviews may have been to blame for IF's lackluster box office pull, leaving any plans for potential sequels strictly in the realm of imagination.\n",

      "Worldwide Box Office: $8.6 million Production Budget: $22 million Needed For Profit: $44 million Estimated Loss (rounded): $35 million Related 10 Box Office Flops That Won Oscars Some films we consider tentpoles today, like Citizen Kane and The Wizard of Oz, failed at the box office.1 \n",
      "The Exorcism marked Russell Crowe's second exorcist movie in as many years (after The Pope's Exorcist last year), with the actor playing a down-and-out actor who begins to experience strange phenomena on a horror film set. He gradually comes to believe that there is an evil spirit on the set of the movie and does all he can to cleanse the area before it gets control of the cast.\n",
      "If the plot of The Exorcism sounds familiar, it's likely because it is the plot of about a dozen other similar films. That might be why Russell Crowe's latest supernatural horror film only earned a paltry $8.6 million in its entire run (according to The Numbers). Even with a minuscule budget, The Exorcism couldn't earn enough to make a profit and was forgotten just as quickly as it arrived.\n",

      "Worldwide Box Office: $35.6 million Production Budget: $40 million Needed For Profit: $80 million Estimated Loss (rounded): $44 million \n",
      "The Bikeriders is a period drama following the exploits of the Vandals Motorcycle Club in 1960s Chicago. The film depicts the dangers that come with living a life of crime, as things quickly spiral out of control from the Vandals. The movie received mostly positive reviews and boasted terrific performances from an impressive cast that included Austin Butler, Jodie Comer, and Tom Hardy.\n",
      "There was some considerable hype for The Bikeriders before it hit theaters but a series of delays may have been responsible for its disappointing $35 million box office total (according to The Numbers). The movie blew competition like The Exorcism and Thelma out of the water, but simply couldn't beat out the enduring popularity of other summer blockbusters, with Inside Out 2 still dominating the box office at the time of The Bikeriders' release.\n",

      "Worldwide Box Office: $22.7 million Production Budget: $40 million Needed For Profit: $80 million Estimated Loss (rounded): $57 million Related This 17-Year-Old Box Office Flop Is One of the Funniest Satires of All Time Many comedies flop and aren't remembered years later, but one flop from almost 20 years ago continues to be a hilarious look at the music industry. \n",
      "Starring Zachary Levi in the lead role, Harold and the Purple Crayon is a film adaptation of the popular children's book series of the same name. The movie imagines an older version of Harold who comes to the real world along with his trusty purple crayon, which can create anything he can imagine.\n",
      "Despite a premise built around imagination itself, Harold and the Purple Crayon is sorely lacking in creativity, which may be blamed for its laughable $22 million box office earnings (according to The Numbers). Additionally, audiences were unmoved by the film's lackluster trailers and instead chose to spend money on other better films released this summer.\n",

      "Worldwide Box Office: $31.5 million Production Budget: $50 million Needed For Profit: $100 million Estimated Loss (rounded): $68.5 million \n",
      "Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter 1 is a passion project from legendary actor Kevin Costner, who financed, directed, co-wrote, produced, and starred in the film. Horizon tells the story of the American expansion westward in the mid-1800s. The film was meant to be the first in a four-part saga that would be the definitive Western epic.\n",
      "Despite considerable work on Costner's part, Horizon only earned $31.5 million (according to The Numbers). Though the movie was responsibly budgeted at only $50 million, its losses are exacerbated by the plans for a four-part franchise. The second film is already shot but has been pulled from the release schedule as New Line Cinema wonders what to do with the rest of the franchise. After Chapter 1's colossal financial failure, the other Horizon sequels may never be released.\n",

      "4 The Crow Is Yet Another Failed Reboot That No One Asked For \n",
      "Worldwide Box Office: $12.7 million Production Budget: $50 million Needed For Profit: $100 million Estimated Loss (rounded): $87 million Related This Historical Box Office Flop Is Surprisingly Underrated Cutthroat Island was an infamous box office disappointment in 1995, and this sadly overshadowed what was actually a fun and entertaining pirate movie. \n",
      "The Crow is a reimagining of the infamous 1994 film of the same name which is inextricably tied to the death and legacy of Brandon Lee. The reimagining follows Eric Draven, a young man who is murdered alongside his girlfriend by a wicked criminal syndicate. When he is resurrected as a vigilante known as the Crow, Draven plans to get revenge on those who killed him and his lover.\n",
      "The Crow was doomed as soon as it was announced, with fans immediately condemning the idea of a reboot. It didn't help that the film itself proved to be a middling, uninspired facsimile of a well-known story. The movie was trampled by its competition and earned an embarrassing $12.7 million worldwide, barely a quarter of its already low production budget (according to The Numbers). Unlike its protagonist, there is little hope for anyone to ever bring The Crow franchise back from the dead.\n",

      "Worldwide Box Office: $172.4 million Production Budget: $168 million Needed For Profit: $336 million Estimated Loss (rounded): $164 million \n",
      "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a dystopian adventure following Charlize Theron's nominal fan-favorite character before the events of Mad Max: Fury Road. Anya Taylor-Joy steps into the role of Furiosa for this prequel, which pits her character against Chris Hemsworth's terrifying dystopian warlord, Dementus.\n",
      "In a surprise twist of fate, Furiosa bombed at the box office, earning only $172.4 million (according to The Numbers). This was quite the shock considering just how excited fans were to see more of Furiosa's character, especially after she proved to be the standout in Fury Road. Nevertheless, mixed reviews may have killed this highly anticipated prequel--and potentially doomed the Mad Max franchise.\n",

      "2 Fly Me To The Moon Plummeted Back To Earth \n",
      "Worldwide Box Office: $20.5 million Production Budget: $100 million Needed For Profit: $200 million Estimated Loss (rounded): $179 million Related 10 Box Office Flops That Were Hits on Netflix Despite their lack of box office sales, these films experienced newfound success after being added to the Netflix library. \n",
      "Fly Me to the Moon is a romantic comedy starring Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson. The film follows a NASA executive and a marketing whiz who meet while they prepare for the Apollo 11 mission. Fly Me to the Moon tells this couple's love story set against the backdrop of one of the most significant historical events of all time.\n",
      "If viewers haven't heard of Fly Me to the Moon, they may not be alone, as the film barely broke the $20 million mark in its entire box office run (according to The Numbers). The movie simply didn't have anything going in its favor, with limited marketing stunting its potential, mixed reviews keeping curious moviegoers from checking it out, and stiff summer competition shutting it out entirely.\n",
      "1 Borderlands Took Video Game Adaptations Back Two Steps Close \n",
      "Worldwide Box Office: $30.9 million Production Budget: $110 million Needed For Profit: $229 million Estimated Loss (rounded): $198 million \n",
      "When it comes to failed films of the summer, there is truly no competition for the biggest flop. Borderlands is a truly terrible video game adaptation that gave neither original fans nor newcomers what they were looking for. Based on the popular video game series of the same name, Borderlands put together a team of misfits for an out-of-this-world mission that supposedly will have major effects on the entire universe.\n",
      "Most box office analysts predicted that Borderlands would flop, but few could foresee just how heavily it would fail. The movie barely scrounged up $30 million at the worldwide box office (according to The Numbers), putting it nearly $200 million in the hole. There are far too many factors that sank Borderlands to list here, but suffice it to say the movie was disappointing on all counts and will forever be remembered as one of the worst video game adaptations of all time.\n",

      "\n",
      "2024 has proven to be a challenging year for Hollywood, with numerous films failing to meet the expectations set by their budgets and marketing campaigns.

Below we explore some of the most significant flops of the year, detailing their budgets, earnings, and the reasons behind their disappointing performances.\n",

      "## 1. **Lisa Frankenstein**\n",
      "- **Budget:** $10 million\n",
      "- **Box Office Earnings:** $9.77 million\n",
      "- **Reason for Poor Performance:** This horror romance film, starring Cole Sprouse and Kathryn Newton, failed to connect with audiences, earning a mediocre 51% on Rotten Tomatoes. Released in February, it struggled against stronger competition and negative word-of-mouth.\n",

      "- **Budget:** $80 million\n",
      "- **Box Office Earnings:** $43.82 million\n",

      "\n",
      "## 4. **Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1**\n",
      "- **Budget:** $50 million\n",
      "- **Box Office Earnings:** $31.5 million\n",
      "- **Reason for Poor Performance:** Kevin Costner's passion project did not resonate with audiences as hoped. Despite its intriguing premise, it was overshadowed by more popular releases and suffered from poor timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Borderlands**\n",
      "- **Budget:** $110 million\n",
      "- **Box Office Earnings:** $30.9 million\n",
      "- **Reason for Poor Performance:** As a video game adaptation, \"Borderlands\" failed to attract both fans of the game and general moviegoers. Critics labeled it a disaster, leading to its status as one of the biggest flops of the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. **Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga**\n",
      "- **Budget:** $168 million\n",

      "- **Budget:** $100 million\n",
      "- **Box Office Earnings:** $20.5 million\n",
      "- **Reason for Poor Performance:** This romantic comedy starring Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson suffered from limited marketing and mixed reviews, leading many to overlook it amid a competitive summer lineup.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 8. **IF**\n",
      "- **Budget:** $110 million\n",
      "- **Box Office Earnings:** $184.7 million\n",

      "\n",
      "## 9. **The Exorcism**\n",
      "- **Budget:** $22 million\n",
      "- **Box Office Earnings:** $8.6 million\n",
      "- **Reason for Poor Performance:** Despite a modest budget, this horror film starring Russell Crowe was unable to attract viewers, likely due to oversaturation in the horror genre and lack of effective marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 10. **The Bikeriders**\n",
      "- **Budget:** $40 million\n",
      "- **Box Office Earnings:** $35.6 million\n",
